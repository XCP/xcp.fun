# XCP-420 Standard

## Overview

XCP-420 is a fair launch standard for Counterparty fairminters designed to ensure equal opportunity, automatic refunds, and zero trust requirements.

## Specification

All XCP-420 compliant fairminters MUST have these exact parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `hard_cap` | 10,000,000 | Maximum tokens that can be minted |
| `soft_cap` | 4,200,000 | Minimum tokens for success (42% of hard cap) |
| `price` | 0.1 XCP | Cost per mint in XCP |
| `quantity_by_price` | 1,000 | Tokens received per mint |
| `max_mint_per_address` | 35,000 | Maximum tokens per address (35 mints) |
| `duration` | 1,000 blocks | Time window for minting (~7 days) |
| `burn_payment` | true | XCP is burned, not sent to creator |
| `lock_quantity` | true | Supply cannot be changed after creation |
| `premint_quantity` | 0 | No tokens pre-allocated to creator |

## Key Features

### Fair Launch
- **No premine**: Creator starts with zero tokens
- **Equal access**: Everyone mints at the same price
- **Max per address**: Prevents whales from taking entire supply

### Automatic Refunds
- If soft cap (4.2M) is not reached, all XCP is automatically refunded
- No trust required - handled by Counterparty protocol
- Creator cannot access funds unless successful

### Supply Lock
- Total supply is locked at creation
- No inflation possible
- Maximum transparency

## Economics

- **Total raise at soft cap**: 420 XCP (4.2M √ó 0.0001)
- **Total raise at hard cap**: 1,000 XCP (10M √ó 0.0001)
- **Max cost per participant**: 3.5 XCP (35 mints √ó 0.1)
- **Max tokens per participant**: 35,000 (3.5% of hard cap)

## Implementation

To create an XCP-420 compliant fairminter:

```python
compose_fairminter(
    source=YOUR_ADDRESS,
    asset=YOUR_ASSET,
    price=100000000,           # 0.1 XCP in satoshis
    quantity_by_price=1000,
    max_mint_per_tx=1000,
    max_mint_per_address=35000,
    hard_cap=10000000,
    soft_cap=4200000,
    start_block=CURRENT_BLOCK,
    end_block=CURRENT_BLOCK + 1000,
    burn_payment=True,
    lock_quantity=True,
    divisible=False,
    premint_quantity=0,
    minted_asset_commission=0
)
```

## Rationale

### Why 420/1000?
- 420 XCP soft cap ensures meaningful community interest
- 1000 XCP hard cap provides upside while limiting risk
- 42% ratio balances achievability with commitment

### Why 1000 blocks?
- ~7 days provides urgency without FOMO
- Allows global participation across timezones
- Long enough for price discovery

### Why 35 mints max?
- Prevents single actors from dominating
- 3.5% max ownership ensures distribution
- 35 mints = memorable number

## Status Display

XCP-420 compliant mints are displayed in four states:

1. **üî• Lit** - Actively minting, accepting burns
2. **üåø Rolled Up** - Created but not yet started
3. **üíÄ Burned** - Successful (soft cap reached)
4. **‚ö∞Ô∏è Ashed** - Failed (refunds triggered)

## Verification

To verify XCP-420 compliance, check:

```javascript
const isXCP420 = (
  fairminter.hard_cap === 10000000 &&
  fairminter.soft_cap === 4200000 &&
  fairminter.price === 100000000 &&
  fairminter.quantity_by_price === 1000 &&
  fairminter.max_mint_per_address === 35000 &&
  fairminter.end_block - fairminter.start_block === 1000 &&
  fairminter.burn_payment === true &&
  fairminter.lock_quantity === true &&
  fairminter.premint_quantity === 0
);
```

## Conclusion

XCP-420 creates a level playing field for token launches on Counterparty, with automatic refunds protecting participants and fixed parameters ensuring fairness.
