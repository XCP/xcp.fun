# XCP-420 Standard

XCP-420 is a fair launch standard for Counterparty fairminters.

There are a lot of possible configurations for fairmints, the goal of this standard is to create a familiar and popular one so that the community can meme safely.

**The basic parameters:**
- 4.2M - 10M supply
- 1,000 tokens earned per mint
- 0.1 XCP burned per mint
- Max 35 mints per address

**The cadence of a XCP-420 mint:**
1. Fairmint is scheduled to begin at start_block
2. Fairmint lasts for 1,000 blocks until end_block (~1 week)
3. IF in that time less than 4.2M tokens are minted, all XCP committed is returned* automatically and no tokens are minted
4. IF in that time more than 4.2M tokens are minted, all XCP committed is burned and the participants receive their tokens

*BTC tx fees are not returned

**The average result:** 1000 XCP burned for ~285 addresses to share 10M tokens.

## Key Features

- **Fair Launch**: No premine, creator starts with zero tokens
- **Automatic Refunds**: If soft cap (4.2M) isn't reached, all XCP is automatically refunded
- **Burn Mechanism**: 0.1 XCP burned per mint (not sent to creator)
- **Anti-Whale**: Max 35,000 tokens per address (0.35% of supply)
- **Supply Lock**: Total supply locked at creation, no inflation possible
- **~7 Day Duration**: Exactly 1000 blocks provides urgency without FOMO
- **No Trust Required**: Handled entirely by Counterparty protocol

## The Standard

XCP-420 compliant fairminters MUST use these parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `hard_cap` | 10,000,000 tokens | Maximum mintable supply |
| `soft_cap` | 4,200,000 tokens | Minimum for success (42% of hard cap) |
| `price` | 0.1 XCP | Cost per mint |
| `quantity_by_price` | 1,000 tokens | Received per mint |
| `max_mint_per_tx` | ≤35,000 tokens | Must equal max_mint_per_address |
| `max_mint_per_address` | ≤35,000 tokens | Can be lower for wider distribution |
| `start_block` | Current or future | When minting begins |
| `end_block` | start_block + 1,000 | Exactly 1,000 blocks later |
| `soft_cap_deadline_block` | Same as end_block | Not actively used |
| `burn_payment` | true | XCP burned, not sent to creator |
| `lock_quantity` | true | Supply locked forever |
| `lock_description` | Optional | Can be true or false |
| `divisible` | true | 8 decimal places |
| `premint_quantity` | 0 | No premine allowed |
| `minted_asset_commission` | 0 | No commission to creator |

**Note:** `max_mint_per_address` can be 35,000 tokens or less, but must be set (cannot be unlimited). Additionally, `max_mint_per_tx` must equal `max_mint_per_address` to allow users to complete all their mints in a single transaction.

**Block Calculation Example:**
- If current block = 869,500
- Set `start_block` = 870,000 (future block)
- Set `end_block` = 871,000 (start + 1000)
- Duration = 871,000 - 870,000 = **exactly 1,000 blocks**

## Compose API

XCP-420 tokens are divisible (8 decimal places), so quantities must be converted to integers for the API.

### Integer Conversion Table

| Parameter | Human Value | API Integer Value |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| `hard_cap` | 10,000,000 tokens | 1000000000000000 |
| `soft_cap` | 4,200,000 tokens | 420000000000000 |
| `price` | 0.1 XCP | 10000000 |
| `quantity_by_price` | 1,000 tokens | 100000000000 |
| `max_mint_per_tx` | 35,000 tokens | 3500000000000 |
| `max_mint_per_address` | 35,000 tokens | 3500000000000 |

### Example Request

```bash
curl "https://api.counterparty.io:4000/v2/addresses/bc1qYOURADDRESS/compose/fairminter?\
asset=MYTOKEN&\
price=10000000&\
quantity_by_price=100000000000&\
max_mint_per_tx=3500000000000&\
max_mint_per_address=3500000000000&\
hard_cap=1000000000000000&\
soft_cap=420000000000000&\
start_block=870000&\
end_block=871000&\
soft_cap_deadline_block=871000&\
burn_payment=true&\
lock_quantity=true&\
divisible=true&\
premint_quantity=0&\
minted_asset_commission=0&\
description=XCP-420%20compliant%20fair%20launch"
```

The API returns a hex-encoded transaction that can be signed and broadcast to create the fairminter.

## Verification

To verify XCP-420 compliance, check these raw integer values:

```javascript
const isXCP420 = (
  fairminter.hard_cap === 1000000000000000 &&
  fairminter.soft_cap === 420000000000000 &&
  fairminter.price === 10000000 &&
  fairminter.quantity_by_price === 100000000000 &&
  fairminter.max_mint_per_address <= 3500000000000 &&
  fairminter.max_mint_per_address > 0 &&
  fairminter.max_mint_per_tx === fairminter.max_mint_per_address &&
  fairminter.end_block - fairminter.start_block === 1000 &&
  fairminter.burn_payment === true &&
  fairminter.lock_quantity === true &&
  fairminter.divisible === true &&
  fairminter.premint_quantity === 0 &&
  fairminter.minted_asset_commission === 0
);
```
