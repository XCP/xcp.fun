🔥 **Burn after minting**

Track XCP-420 standard fairminters on Counterparty.

## What is XCP-420?

A fair launch standard for Counterparty tokens with these fixed parameters:

- **10M** hard cap
- **4.2M** soft cap
- **0.1 XCP** burned per mint
- **1000 tokens** earned per mint
- **35 mints** max per address
- **1000 blocks** duration (~7 days)
- **Supply locked** (no inflation)
- **No premine** (fair launch)

## How it works

1. **Lit** 🔥 - Active mints accepting XCP burns
2. **Rolled Up** 🌿 - Scheduled to start soon
3. **Burned** 💀 - Successful (soft cap reached, XCP burned forever)
4. **Ashed** ⚰️ - Failed (soft cap missed, XCP automatically refunded)

## Fair by design

If a mint doesn't reach its 4.2M soft cap, the Counterparty protocol **automatically refunds all XCP** to participants. No trust required.
